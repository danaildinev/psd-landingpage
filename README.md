# psd-landingpage

This is a randomly chosen design from the internet that I decided to code for an exercise.

Notes:
- Coded for very short period of time - its not real project and I dont want to waste any time with it;
- Default font is 'Open Sans' instead of 'AktivGrotesk';
- Some of the shapes in PSD are actually no shapes, so I exported them as png instead of svg and create custom icon font :/
- Used latest version of 'Font Awesome' so some icons may be different from the PSD;
- There is no responsive layout in PSD file, so I improvised and gave my best to get it responsive;
- 'Steps' section in homepage can be replaced with js lib that generates custom svg wave and popups, but I prefered to hard code it like in the design with some basic attributes to configre it;
- I am using my own carousel - [Try it and leave feedback](https://github.com/danaildinev/ddcarousel) :D
- Tested on latest versions of Chrome and Firefox;
- No js minified;
- SCSS is compiled and minified with VS Code extention 'Live Sass Compiler' (ritwickdey.live-sass);
